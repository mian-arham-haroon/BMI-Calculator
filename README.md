# 🔢 BMI Calculator App using Tkinter

The BMI Calculator App is a user-friendly Python-based GUI application built using Tkinter 🐍. It allows users to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) 🧍‍♂️🧍‍♀️ by entering their height (in centimeters 📏) and weight (in kilograms ⚖️) using interactive sliders 🎚️. The app features real-time updates, intuitive visuals, and categorized health feedback.
